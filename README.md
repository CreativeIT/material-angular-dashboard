# Material Angular Dashboard

Welcome to first dark dashboard on Material Design Lite and Angular!

Material admin template is absolutely free for commercial usage theme, that uses google's implementation of material design -- [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io) library.

> **Important**: We are still working on the project and there will be much more awesome, check out our [issues](https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-angular-dashboard/issues) to see what features are coming soon.

# SETUP and USAGE

The steps below will take you through cloning your own fork, installing dependencies and building:

1. Fork and/or clone our repository. To use Git from command line, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-angular-dashboard.git
```

2. Open your copied repo folder in terminal and install necessary modules with command:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. _(optional)_ Install [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) globally to use its commands in the terminal:

```bash
yarn global add @angular/cli
```

4. Now you are able to run or build project:

Run `yarn start` or `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `yarn run build` or `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

# Additional

Since the project uses [BEM](http://getbem.com) structure with sass, it can be customized in easy way by editing `src/theme/scss/_variables.scss` file.

Google hasn't implemented select element yet ([see why here](http://37.media.tumblr.com/6a9fcffde2da977266b0ea99b15d5803/tumblr_n42cjjsriB1smcbm7o1_400.gif)), that is why the project depends on [getmdl-select plugin](https://github.com/CreativeIT/getmdl-select). Also project uses [d3](https://d3js.org/) and [nvd3](http://nvd3.org/) to build charts and chart components.
