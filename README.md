1. Fork and/or clone our repository. To use Git from command line, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles.

# Quick start
Do you want to start quickly and don't need all the pages and modules? You can checkout to empty 
[starter-kit branch](https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-angular-dashboard/tree/starter-kit) and get to work!

If you need full-stack solution with authentication ability and routing, checkout
[feature/backend branch](https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-angular-dashboard/tree/feature/backend) with preconfigured Node.js backend.
You can also try the [demo](http://dashboard-auth-demo.creativeit.io) (user: admin@admin.admin , password: admin).

You can also try dashboard powered with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). This allows you to easily deploy your application without the need for a dedicated server.
Checkout [feature/serverless branch](https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-angular-dashboard/tree/feature/serverless) to see the details or try the [demo](https://g5ope910kg.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/production/) (user: admin@admin.admin , password: admin) to make sure that this is no different from the classic approach.
