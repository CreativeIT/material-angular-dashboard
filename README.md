# SETUP and USAGE

The steps below will take you through cloning your own fork, installing dependencies and building:

1. Fork and/or clone our repository. To use Git from command line, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CreativeIT/material-angular-dashboard.git
```

2. Open your copied repo folder in terminal and checkout `feature/serverless` branch to use bundle with backend.

```bash
git checkout feature/serverless
```

3. Install necessary modules, make sure that you have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm):

```bash
npm install
```

4. Install [serverless](https://serverless.com/) globally to use its commands in the terminal:

```bash
npm install --global serverless

5. Install [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to manage AWS services (AWS Lambda in our case), make sure that you have installed [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):

```bash
pip install awscli
```

6. [Configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) awscli:
